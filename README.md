# ðŸ”’ AuthWatch: Log Analysis & Threat Detection  

AuthWatch is a cybersecurity tool designed to analyze authentication logs, detect unusual login activity, and check IP reputation using AbuseIPDB. It provides a structured way to investigate failed logins, whether from real-time Windows Event Logs or imported log files.  

## Features  

- **Analyze authentication logs** from Windows Event Viewer or a CSV file  
- **Identify suspicious login attempts** based on IP reputation  
- **Automatically export findings** to a CSV for further review  
- **Fallback to CSV mode** when event logs are unavailable  

## ðŸ›  **Using the Fake Log Generator for Testing**
To help with testing, a fake authentication log generator is included in the `/tools/` directory.  
This script can generate simulated failed logins**, including brute-force attempts, password spraying, and RDP login failures.  

### **Run the Log Generator**
```powershell
.\tools\AuthWatch-Login-Generator.ps1
```
This will create a CSV file with realistic login failures, which you can then analyze with AuthWatch:  
```powershell
.\AuthWatch.ps1 -useCsv
```

## How to Use  

### Analyze Windows Event Logs (requires admin privileges)  
```powershell
.\AuthWatch.ps1
```

### Analyze a CSV file instead of Event Logs  
```powershell
.\AuthWatch.ps1 -useCsv
```
Ensure the CSV exists at:  
```
C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\FailedLogins.csv
```

### Output  
The results will be saved in:  
```
C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\AuthWatch_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

## Real-World Use Case  

AuthWatch helps detect failed login attempts and identify potential threats using IP reputation analysis. It can be used by security analysts, IT admins, or anyone monitoring authentication logs.  

## Roadmap  

- [ ] Add geolocation lookup for flagged IPs  
- [ ] Improve detection by integrating multiple threat intelligence sources  
- [ ] Expand log support for failed RDP and Kerberos authentication events  
- [ ] Implement real-time alerting for high-risk IPs

### **What's Changed?**
âœ… **Added a "Using the Fake Log Generator for Testing"** section  
âœ… **Updated instructions to reflect the `/tools/` folder**  
âœ… **Kept it clear and concise without AI-style over-formatting**  

This now **properly documents the log generator** as part of the project while making it clear how to use it for testing. Let me know if you want any tweaks! ðŸš€
